## Projects
### 1 - Breaking chocolate problem - Codewars
- Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

- For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.

- If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.

### 2 - Number of People in the Bus - Codewars
- There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.

- You are provided with a list (or array) of integer pairs. Elements of each pair represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.

- Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there.
